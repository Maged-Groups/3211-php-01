# 🧑‍💻 PHP OOP + GitHub Practical Challenge

## 🎯 Objective
This exercise aims to help you practice **Git** and **GitHub** operations while building a small **PHP OOP** project.  
You will create multiple commits — each with a specific name — that include **adding**, **modifying**, and **deleting** files or content.

---

## 📂 Project Name
> `php-oop-git-training`

---

## 🧱 Instructions
Each step below must be done in a **separate commit** using the **exact commit name** provided.

Every commit must include:
- Adding one or more new files  
- Modifying existing files  
- Deleting a file, line, or piece of code  

---

### 🟩 1. Initialize the project and create the main class  
**Commit name:** `init project with main class`

- Create a folder named `php-oop-git-training`
- Add a file called `index.php`
- Inside a new folder `classes/`, create a file `User.php` containing a `User` class with properties `name` and `email`
- Print a simple message in `index.php`
- Modify `index.php` by adding new code
- Remove any unnecessary test code

---

### 🟨 2. Add an Admin class using inheritance  
**Commit name:** `add admin class with inheritance`

- Create a new class `Admin` that extends `User`
- Add a `role` property
- Modify the `User` class to include a method `getInfo()`
- Remove unused or temporary code/comments

---

### 🟦 3. Refactor the project structure  
**Commit name:** `refactor project structure`

- Create a folder named `includes/` and move `index.php` into it
- Update all file paths (e.g., `require` or `include`)
- Delete any old or unused file/content

---

### 🟧 4. Add a user registration feature  
**Commit name:** `add user registration feature`

- Create a file `functions/register.php`
- Add a function for registering a new user (it can be a simple simulation, no database required)
- Modify `index.php` to use this new function
- Remove any outdated variables or test code

---

### 🟥 5. Add a README and finalize the project  
**Commit name:** `add readme and final cleanup`

- Create a `README.md` file describing the project
- Rename some files to make them clearer (e.g., `index.php` → `main.php`)
- Delete unused or test files
- Ensure the project runs correctly

---

## 🚀 Final Submission
1. Create a new **GitHub repository** named `php-oop-git-training`  
2. Push your project with all commits in the correct order  
3. Submit the GitHub repository link
